To get us started, I’d like to clarify a few key points so we can tailor the simulation to your needs:

1. Scope & Mechanics  
   • Which species or trophic levels do you want? (e.g. grass → rabbits → foxes, or plants & herbivores only?)  
   • What interactions? (e.g. eating, reproduction, starvation, migration, disease?)  
   • Will the world be a 2D grid, free‐moving agents, or purely number‐based population counters?

2. Player Interaction & Goals  
   • What control does the player have? (e.g. seeding populations, changing birth/death rates, introducing predators, harvesting resources)  
   • Is there a win/lose condition or an open‐ended sandbox?  
   • How do you want to score or measure success? (e.g. longest species survival, maximum biodiversity, steady‐state population)

3. Visualization & Interface  
   • Do you want a live grid display (colored cells or simple shapes) or just numeric dashboards & charts?  
   • Should it run automatically with a “Play/Pause” button, or advance one tick at a time via user clicks?

4. Platform Integration  
   • We’ll need to create a session, log each simulation step or summary statistics, and close the session when the player stops.  
   • Do you have any special data you’d like to record (e.g. time to extinction, peak population, stability periods)?

Once I know which species, user controls, and visual style you want, I can draft a complete single‐file HTML prototype—styled via a `<style>` tag, scripted with standard DOM APIs, and wired up to the RandomPlayables platform (session start, data logging, session end). Let me know your preferences on the above points!
